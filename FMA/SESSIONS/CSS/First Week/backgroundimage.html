        Protecting nature involves small actions that make a big difference. Reduce waste by recycling, conserve water, and save energy by using efficient appliances. Plant trees, support wildlife conservation, and choose eco-friendly products. Opt for sustainable transport like walking or biking, and advocate for policies that protect the environment. Every effort counts in preserving our planet for future generations.
