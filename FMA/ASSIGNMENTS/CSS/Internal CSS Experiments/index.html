    </h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]</p>

    <p>There are 3 types of CSS: Inline CSS, internal CSS and external CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do we need CSS?</h2>
    <p>The primary function of CSS is to define the styling and layout of web pages, making them more visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible. CSS provides a way to define and apply styles consistently across all pages of a website, making it easier for developers to maintain and update their designs.</p>
