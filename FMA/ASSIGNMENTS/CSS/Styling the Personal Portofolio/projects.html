                <h1>Project 1-How To Make Math Easier</h1>
                <p>This <strong>project</strong> is intended to make an app so that <ins>math</ins> students in the future have it easier to search online for <i>information</i> related to math. Basically you can learn math on this app without a teacher and you can solve problems by just taking a photo of the problem, then you're given the solution and the answer, this also works for word problems.
                It's very useful for math students that compete in <strong>math</strong> <ins>olympiads</ins>. It's a very difficult project, but I hope that one day I complete it!</p>

                <h1>Project 2-Making Studying Easier</h1>
                <p>In this <strong>project</strong> I plan on developing an app that can make studying easier in various different ways. One of the <i>features </i>is that you scan  photos of <i>textbooks</i>, <i></i> and <i>notes</i> and  <strong>the app</strong> can summarise them in <ins>short points</ins> while keeping the main idea and maybe adding some necessary information. The app also works for <strong>online</strong> books and content, and it will also provide a short quiz for testing you and your knowledge. Teachers can also make exams and <strong>tests</strong> and submit them for their students to complete them before the <i>deadline</i>. You can also share videos and presentations with people and in this way you can build<strong> a community</strong> where people share their knowledge.</p>

                <h1>Project 3-Cooking Guide</h1>
                <p>For this <ins>project</ins> I will make an app that has thousands of cooking recipees from different <i>cultures</i>. You can also invent your own recipee and share it with others. The special thing about this app is that if you have no idea what to make with the <strong>ingredients</strong> that are available, you can type your ingredients and the app will give you a quick and easy recipee or a hard and complex one depending on your mood. You can also make videos and <strong><ins>share them</ins></strong> with other people so that in that way people can also learn how to cook.</p>
